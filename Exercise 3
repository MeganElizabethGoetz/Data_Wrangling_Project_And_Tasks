-- Question 1: This code gave me the different categories: Activity Monitoring, COPD, Diabetes, Hypertension, & Congestive Heart Failure:

select tri_name from Conditions
group by tri_name

-- 1. COPD count:

select distinct * from Conditions
where tri_name = 'COPD'

--2. Diabetes count:

select distinct * from Conditions
where tri_name = 'Diabetesâ€™

-- 3. Hypertension count:  Used the same code method as 1. & 2.

-- Question 2:

-- Part 1:
--Average height of outpatient:

select distinct * into mgoetz.number2Height from Flowsheets f
left join
Outpatient o
on
f.PAT_ENC_CSN_ID = o.NEW_PAT_ENC_CSN_ID
where o.PATIENT_DOB_CATEGORY = 'Over 64' and f.DISP_NAME = 'Height'

select avg(MEAS_VALUE) from mgoetz.number2Height

-- This gave me an average height of about w inches.

--I just tried a simpler solution, after finding the simple solution for #3 and it gives me almost an identical answer:

select distinct avg(meas_value) from Flowsheets f
inner JOIN
Outpatient o
ON
f.PAT_ENC_CSN_ID = o.NEW_PAT_ENC_CSN_ID
WHERE DISP_NAME = 'Height' and MEAS_VALUE > 0 and PATIENT_DOB_CATEGORY = 'Over 64'

-- returns a value of x

--Part 2:
--Average height of inpatient:

select distinct * into mgoetz.number2InHeight from Flowsheets f2
left join
Inpatient i
ON
f2.PAT_ENC_CSN_ID = i.NEW_PAT_ENC_CSN_ID
where i.DOB_CATEGORY = 'Over 64' and f2.DISP_NAME = 'Height'
select avg(MEAS_VALUE) from mgoetz.number2InHeight

-- This gave me an average height of about z inches.

--I took the same second approach as in part 1:

select distinct avg(meas_value) from Flowsheets f
inner JOIN
Inpatient i
ON
f.PAT_ENC_CSN_ID = i.NEW_PAT_ENC_CSN_ID
WHERE DISP_NAME = 'Height' and MEAS_VALUE > 0 and DOB_CATEGORY = 'Over 64'

-- and actually did get an identical answer this time of b.

-- Question 3:

SELECT distinct AVG(MEAS_VALUE) from Dx d
inner join
Flowsheets f
on
d.NEW_PAT_ENC_CSN_ID = f.PAT_ENC_CSN_ID
where DISP_NAME = 'Height' and DX_NAME like '%hypertens%'

-- average height for patients suffering from hypertension is about c inches.

SELECT distinct AVG(MEAS_VALUE) from Dx d
inner join
Flowsheets f
on
d.NEW_PAT_ENC_CSN_ID = f.PAT_ENC_CSN_ID
where DISP_NAME = 'Weight' and DX_NAME like '%hypertens%'

-- average weight is about d oz's.

SELECT distinct AVG(MEAS_VALUE) from Dx d
inner join
Flowsheets f
on
d.NEW_PAT_ENC_CSN_ID = f.PAT_ENC_CSN_ID
where DISP_NAME like '%BMI%' and DX_NAME like '%hypertens%'
