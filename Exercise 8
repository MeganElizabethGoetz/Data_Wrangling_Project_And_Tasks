#Because climate change is such a universal, hot topic and prominent issue, 
#there are so many results within the last 3 years that we canâ€™t load them all within 1 query:

#Code:


```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropengov/rtimes")
library("ropengov/rtimes")
library(rtimes)
```

```{r}

API_key <- "my_api_key"
art_ser_clim_delta <- as_search(q="climate change",begin_date="20171126",end_date="20201126",key=API_key,page = 0)
art_ser_clim_delta
```


#All I had to do to produce the last 5 of the 6 screenshots is increase the page number by 1 every time to look at the next 10 most recent results.

#code:

install.packages("twitteR")
library(twitteR) 

API_key <- "my_API_key"

API_secret_key <-"my_api_secret_key"

access_token <- "my_access_token"

access_token_secret <- "my_access_token_secret" 

setup_twitter_oauth(API_key, API_secret_key, access_token, access_token_secret)

tw_result = twitteR::searchTwitter('#earthhour', n = 8, since = '2018-11-27')
tw_result #prints result

#Double-checked that the tweets include the #earthhour hashtag:

#The very first result is from @geographycarrie.
