#Made all entries in DX_NAME lowercase:
#code: 

DX$DX_NAME <- tolower(DX$DX_NAME)

#2. Remove commas: ^ this is the output for DX_NAME without the commas as well:

#The code for this is: 

DX$DX_NAME <- gsub(",","",DX$DX_NAME,fixed=TRUE)

#Remove spaces: The code for this is:

DX$DX_NAME <- gsub(" ","",DX$DX_NAME,fixed=TRUE)

#3. Removed hyphens of Inpatient NEW_PATIENT_DHMC_MRN:

#code:

Inpatient$NEW_PATIENT_DHMC_MRN <-gsub("-","",Inpatient$NEW_PATIENT_DHMC_MRN,fixed=TRUE)

#Same exact code for removing hyphens for Outpatient

# Here are the two data tables merged:
#code for tables merging:

in_and_out_patients <-merge(Inpatient,Outpatient,by="NEW_PATIENT_DHMC_MRN")
View(in_and_out_patients)

#4. For merging by NEW_PATIENT_DHMC_MRN, we get w patients.

#And this is what we get when we attempt to merge on NEW_PAT_ID with this code:

in_and_out_patients2 <- merge(Inpatient,Outpatient,by="NEW_PAT_ID")
View(in_and_out_patients2)
