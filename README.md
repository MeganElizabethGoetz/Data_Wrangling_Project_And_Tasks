# Data_Wrangling_Project_And_Tasks
A synthesis of all my R and SQL code for my first Data Wrangling class in my graduate program: Master of Science in Quantitative Biomedical Sciences: Health Data Sciences. I used R code mainly in Rstudio and used SQL code in both the Azure SQL Server and Rstudio via an ODBC connection.
