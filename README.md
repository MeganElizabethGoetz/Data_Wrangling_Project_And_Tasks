# Data_Wrangling_Project_And_Tasks
A synthesis of all my R and SQL code for my first Data Wrangling class in my graduate program: Master of Science in Quantitative Biomedical Sciences: Health Data Sciences. I used R code mainly in Rstudio and used SQL code in both the Azure SQL Server and Rstudio via an ODBC connection.

This is a place to keep all my files in an easily accesible way, for others to see how they can do some ameateur wrangling with similar datasets, and to easily exhibit to future employers and/or mentors where I am at in my skill level of data wrangling.

I have been given permission from my professor to make my work public. I have altered outputs and inputs throughout my code to sensor any numeric and identity data, with either blank indices: [], or variables like "There are x records."
